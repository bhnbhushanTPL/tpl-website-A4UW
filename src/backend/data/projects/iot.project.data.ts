        projectTitle:"Thirsty Carrot",
        projectDescription : "The idea behind Thirsty Carrot  iOS app is to automate the process of measuring the soil moisture. The app communicates with moisture sensors and collects real-time data related to soil moisture, battery, etc. It generates notifications when the soil moisture crosses the threshold and also manages connection with the sensor when the device is in range. The app communicates with the moisture sensors via Bluetooth Low Energy. The sensors are BLE peripherals which act as GATT servers. The app acts as Central manager and triggers the connection with the sensors. The app gathers both current and historic data from the sensors and persists in a local storage which is a SQLite database.The app provides an interface to the user for configuration of sensor level and general settings.",

        projectDescription : "Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis are the best technologies that not only evolve continuously but also used in today's web applications. As of today, they have the greatest impact on human interaction with machines. The simple motive behind this is: 'If I can speak why should I type!'. So Here at Techprimelab our Engineers are enhancing the Speech Recognition System by adding extra layer of Neural Network Learning Algorithms (both Unsupervised and Supervised) to fulfil the client's need in specific area such as Medical fields, Agriculture, Military Services etc. Our ultimate mission is to make Machine Interactions independent of external peripheral devices.",
