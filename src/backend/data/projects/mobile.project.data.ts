        projectTitle:"Thirsty Carrot",
        projectDescription : "The idea behind Thirsty Carrot  iOS app is to automate the process of measuring the soil moisture. The app communicates with moisture sensors and collects real-time data related to soil moisture, battery, etc. It generates notifications when the soil moisture crosses the threshold and also manages connection with the sensor when the device is in range. The app communicates with the moisture sensors via Bluetooth Low Energy. The sensors are BLE peripherals which act as GATT servers. The app acts as Central manager and triggers the connection with the sensors. The app gathers both current and historic data from the sensors and persists in a local storage which is a SQLite database.The app provides an interface to the user for configuration of sensor level and general settings.",
